## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first whole landing site project, took most time compared to other previous project, but i'm still impressed with the time i took to complete it on a normal pace. continuing the responsiveness, this works great, it is an mix of everything from previous challenges, so it kinda revises all the learning from back

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
